# Problem Framing: Battery Lifespan Factores

Potential solution
- 1. Define the probelm : What is the user need or problem we are trying to address?
     We are addressing the problem where we can Optamize battery charging for lifespana and best user exprience.
- 2. Hypothezise about data: Could ML add value to this problem? if so, what data could be useful for creating an ML-based solution?
     I think ML can defiently solve this problem, we need data of customer survery usesage or repair data about battery lifepan when it come to the geinus bar, knowing that is pretty          accurate. Wr tell store reatil employee to give a feebeback when you see a battery issue witht he current users.
- 3. Consider the user experience(UX): How do we plan to evaluate whether a solution is successful in terms of desired user impacts?
     currently we have no data and we can't able to send a whole survery to the customer users, so we make a UX/UI update on te retail devices to give us the feedback.

#Battery Lifespan    
Battery lifespan is the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced. In order to be replaced. In order to mazimize lifespan, and optimize charging. You'll need to about the mian causes of battery degradation. 

- What contribtues to battery degradtion?
  Apple devices typically use lithium-ion batteries, whichn tend to charge faster and last longer than traditional battery techonologies. Three of the biggest factors that degrade lithium-ion batteries are :
  1. Extreme temperatures
  2. Charge cycles
  3. Higly-charges states
- General Use (Charge cycles) and extreme temperatures may be difficult to aviod for all users, and so the OBC feature focuses on just one main cause of degradatoin:
  1. Highly-Charges states: If a battery stays in a highly charged states- defind as between 80-100% charged for a long period of time this creates stress on the battery that can decrease capaity in the long term. so any time spent charging from 80-100% charge, or maintaining a 10% charge, is especially wearing on them.
 
 #Optimized Battery Charging(OBC)

What: OBC is designed to extend your battery's lifespan by reducing the time your device spends in damaging, higly-charged states. 
How: On th iphone, when this feature is enabled your iPhone will pause charging past 80% in certain situations. 

#Evaluatoin 
1. What advice would you give someone like Andy in order to proling the lngviety of his battery?
   1. Suggests a healtheir range for a typical charge level.
   2. considers the definition of higly-charged. which is described as 80=100%.
   3. Addresses the situation that anuser may still need 100% charge occasinally. 
2. Why would someone (or a company) want to extend battery lifespan?
   user experience and the environemnt
3. What is the desired impact of OBC?
   Reduce the time decvies spend in a highly-charges state.
